<p data-aid="156932863" id="p3">After my wife, Anne, and I received a call to serve as full-time mission leaders, our family determined to learn each missionary’s name before arriving in the field. We obtained photos, created flash cards, and began studying faces and memorizing names.</p>
<p data-aid="156932871" id="p51">Once we arrived, we held introductory conferences with the missionaries. As we mingled, I overheard our nine-year-old son:</p>
<p data-aid="156932880" id="p52">“Nice to meet you, Sam!”</p>
<p data-aid="156932889" id="p53">“Rachel, where are you from?”</p>
<p data-aid="156932897" id="p54">“Wow, David, you’re tall!”</p>
<p data-aid="156932904" id="p55">Alarmed, I went to our son and whispered, “Hey, let’s remember to refer to the missionaries as Elder or Sister.”</p>
<p data-aid="156932911" id="p56">He gave me a puzzled look and said, “Dad, I thought we were supposed to memorize their <em>names</em>.” Our son did what he thought was right based on his understanding.</p>
<p data-aid="156932918" id="p57">So, what is our understanding of truth in today’s world? We are constantly bombarded with strong opinions, biased reporting, and incomplete data. At the same time, the volume and sources of this information are proliferating. Our need to recognize truth has never been more important!</p>
<p data-aid="156932926" id="p4">Truth is critical for us to establish and strengthen our relationship with God, find peace and joy, and reach our divine potential. Today, let us consider the following questions:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="156932936" id="p5">What is truth, and why is it important?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="156932946" id="p6">How do we find truth?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="156932957" id="p7">When we find truth, how can we share it?</p>

<h2 data-aid="156932992" id="title4">God Reveals Eternal Truth</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="156933001" id="p10">God reveals eternal truth to us through a <em>network of revelatory relationships</em> involving Himself, Jesus Christ, the Holy Ghost, prophets, and us. Let us discuss the distinct yet interconnected roles each participant plays in this process.</p>
<p data-aid="156933010" id="p11">First, God is <em>the</em> source of eternal truth.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note11" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note11"><sup class="marker">11</sup></a> He and His Son, Jesus Christ,<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note12" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note12"><sup class="marker">12</sup></a> have a perfect understanding of truth and always act in harmony with true principles and laws.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note13" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note13"><sup class="marker">13</sup></a> This power allows Them to create and govern worlds<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note14" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note14"><sup class="marker">14</sup></a> as well as to love, guide, and nurture each one of us perfectly.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note15" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note15"><sup class="marker">15</sup></a> They want <em>us</em> to understand and apply truth so <em>we</em> can enjoy the blessings They do.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note16" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note16"><sup class="marker">16</sup></a> They may impart truth in person or, more typically, through messengers such as the Holy Ghost, angels, or living prophets.</p>
<p data-aid="156933020" id="p12">Second, the Holy Ghost testifies of all truth.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note17" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note17"><sup class="marker">17</sup></a> He reveals truths to us directly and witnesses of truth taught by others. Impressions from the Spirit typically come as thoughts to our minds and feelings to our hearts.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note18" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note18"><sup class="marker">18</sup></a></p>
<p data-aid="156933029" id="p14">Third, prophets receive truth from God and share that truth with us.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note19" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note19"><sup class="marker">19</sup></a> We learn the truth from past prophets in the scriptures<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note20" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note20"><sup class="marker">20</sup></a> and from living prophets at general conference and through other official channels.</p>
<p data-aid="156933037" id="p15">Finally, you and I play a crucial role in this process. God expects us to seek, recognize, and act on truth. Our ability to receive and apply truth is dependent on the strength of our relationship with the Father and the Son, our responsiveness to the influence of the Holy Ghost, and our alignment with latter-day prophets.</p>
<p data-aid="156933045" id="p58">We need to remember that Satan works to keep us from truth. He knows that without truth, we cannot gain eternal life. He weaves strands of truth with worldly philosophies to confuse us and distract us from what is communicated by God.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note21" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note21"><sup class="marker">21</sup></a></p>

</header>
<p data-aid="156933061" id="p16">As we seek eternal truth,<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note22" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note22"><sup class="marker">22</sup></a> the following two questions can help us recognize whether a concept comes from God or from another source:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
<li>
<p data-aid="156933070" id="p17">Is the concept taught consistently in the scriptures and by living prophets?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p data-aid="156933077" id="p18">Is the concept confirmed by the witness of the Holy Ghost?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-aid="156933084" id="p19">God reveals doctrinal truths through prophets, and the Holy Ghost confirms those truths to us and helps us apply them.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note23" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note23"><sup class="marker">23</sup></a> We must seek and be prepared to receive these spiritual impressions when they come.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note24" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note24"><sup class="marker">24</sup></a> We are most receptive to the witness of the Spirit when we are humble,<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note25" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note25"><sup class="marker">25</sup></a> pray sincerely and study God’s words,<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note26" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note26"><sup class="marker">26</sup></a> and keep His commandments.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note27" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note27"><sup class="marker">27</sup></a></p>
<p data-aid="156933091" id="p21">Once the Holy Ghost confirms a specific truth to us, our understanding deepens as we put that principle into practice. Over time, as we consistently live the principle, we gain a sure knowledge of that truth.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note28" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note28"><sup class="marker">28</sup></a></p>
<p data-aid="156933098" id="p22">For example, I have made mistakes and felt remorse for poor choices. But through prayer, study, and faith in Jesus Christ, I received a witness of the principle of repentance.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note29" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note29"><sup class="marker">29</sup></a> As I continued to repent, my understanding of repentance grew stronger. I felt closer to God and His Son. I now <em>know</em> that sin can be forgiven through Jesus Christ, because I experience the blessings of repentance each day.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note30" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note30"><sup class="marker">30</sup></a></p>

</header>
<p data-aid="156933112" id="p23">So, what should we do when we sincerely seek for truth not yet revealed? I have empathy for those of us who yearn for answers that do not seem to come.</p>
<p data-aid="156933119" id="p24">To Joseph Smith, the Lord counseled, “Hold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things known … concerning the matter” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.37?lang=eng#p37">Doctrine and Covenants 10:37</a>).</p>
<p data-aid="156933126" id="p25">And to Emma Smith, He explained, “Murmur not because of the things which thou hast not seen, for they are withheld from thee and from the world, which is wisdom in me in a time to come” (<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/25.4?lang=eng#p4">Doctrine and Covenants 25:4</a>).</p>

<h2 data-aid="156933138" id="title7">Understanding Doctrine and Policy</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="156933143" id="p28">When seeking truth, it helps to understand the difference between doctrine and policy. Doctrine refers to eternal truths, such as the nature of the Godhead, the plan of salvation, and Jesus Christ’s atoning sacrifice. Policy is the application of doctrine based on current circumstances. Policy helps us administer the Church in an orderly way.</p>
<p data-aid="156933149" id="p29">While doctrine never changes, policy adjusts from time to time. The Lord works through His prophets to uphold His doctrine <em>and</em> to modify Church policies according to the needs of His children.</p>
<p data-aid="156933155" id="p30">Unfortunately, we sometimes confuse policy with doctrine. If we do not understand the difference, we risk becoming disillusioned when policies change and may even begin to question God’s wisdom or the revelatory role of prophets.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note33" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/52pingree?lang=eng#note33"><sup class="marker">33</sup></a></p>

<p data-aid="156933216" id="p42">How we teach truth really matters. Paul encouraged us to speak “the truth in love” (see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/eph/4.14-15?lang=eng#p14">Ephesians 4:14–15</a>).

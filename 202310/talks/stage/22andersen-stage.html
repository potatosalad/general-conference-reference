<h1>Tithing: Opening the Windows of Heaven</h1>
<p><em>Elder Neil L. Andersen Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles</em></p>

<p data-aid="156931523" id="p1">While I was in South America recently, Brother Roger Parra from Venezuela shared the following experience with me:</p>
<p data-aid="156931528" id="p2">“In 2019 Venezuela was shaken by problems that caused a power blackout for five days.</p>
<p data-aid="156931532" id="p3">“Chaos and anarchy reigned in the streets, and many desperate people did not have sufficient food.</p>
<p data-aid="156931537" id="p4">“Some began looting food businesses, destroying everything in their path.</p>
<p data-aid="156931542" id="p5">“As the owner of a small bakery, I was very worried about our business. As a family, we decided to give away all the food in our bakery to people in need.</p>
<p data-aid="156931547" id="p6">“Through one very dark night riots were everywhere. My only concern was for the safety of my beloved wife and children.</p>
<p data-aid="156931552" id="p7">“At dawn I went to our bakery. Sadly, every nearby food business had been destroyed by looters, but to my great astonishment, our bakery was intact. Nothing had been destroyed. I humbly thanked my Heavenly Father.</p>
<p data-aid="156931558" id="p8">“Arriving home, I told my family of God’s blessing and protection.</p>
<p data-aid="156931564" id="p9">“They were all so grateful.</p>
<p data-aid="156931570" id="p10">“My oldest son, Rogelio, only 12&nbsp;years old, said, ‘Papa! I know why our store was protected. You and Mama always pay your tithes.’”</p>
<p data-aid="156931576" id="p11">Brother Parra concluded: “The words of Malachi came into my mind. ‘I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground’ [<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.11?lang=eng#p11">Malachi 3:11</a>]. We knelt down and gratefully thanked our Heavenly Father for His miracle.”<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note1" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note1"><sup class="marker">1</sup></a></p>

<p data-aid="156931595" id="p13">With all the Lord gives to us, He has asked us to return to Him and His kingdom on earth 10&nbsp;percent of our increase.

<p data-aid="156931621" id="p40">The Apostle Paul warned that the wisdom of men understands the things of men but has difficulty understanding the things of God.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note8" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note8"><sup class="marker">8</sup></a> The world speaks of tithing in terms of our money, but the sacred law of tithing is principally a matter of our faith. Being honest in our tithes is one way we show our willingness to put the Lord first in our lives, above our own cares and interest. I promise you that as you trust in the Lord, the blessings of heaven will follow.</p>
<p data-aid="156931627" id="p17">Jesus said to give “unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.”<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note9" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note9"><sup class="marker">9</sup></a> The resurrected Savior asked the Nephites to write into their record His promises found in Malachi.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note10" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note10"><sup class="marker">10</sup></a> In our day, the Lord reconfirmed the divine law of tithing, declaring: “This shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people.

</header>
<p data-aid="156931645" id="p41">These sacred funds do not belong to the leaders of the Church. They belong to the Lord. His servants are painstakingly aware of the sacred nature of their stewardship.</p>
<p data-aid="156931650" id="p20">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley recounted this childhood experience: “When I was a boy I raised a question with my father … concerning the expenditure of Church funds. He reminded me that mine is the God-given obligation to pay my tithes and offerings. When I do so, [my father said,] that which I give is no longer mine. It belongs to the Lord to whom I consecrate it.” His father added: “What the authorities of the Church do with it need not concern [you, Gordon]. They are answerable to the Lord, who will require an accounting at their hands.”<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note15" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note15"><sup class="marker">15</sup></a></p>

<p data-aid="156931697" id="p28">The spiritual power of the divine law of tithing is not measured by the amount of money contributed, for both the prosperous and the poor are commanded by the Lord to contribute 10&nbsp;percent of their income.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note22" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note22"><sup class="marker">22</sup></a> The power comes from placing our trust in the Lord.<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note23" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note23"><sup class="marker">23</sup></a></p>

<h2 data-aid="156931709" id="p30">Blessings Come in Many Ways</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="156931715" id="p43">The blessings of tithing come in many ways. In 1998 I accompanied then-Elder Henry&nbsp;B. Eyring to a large Church meeting in the Utah area now known as Silicon Slopes, a community of great innovation in technology. It was a time of growing prosperity, and Elder Eyring cautioned the Saints about comparing what they had with others and wanting more. I will always remember his promise that as they paid an honest tithe, their desire for more material possessions would diminish. Within two years, the technology bubble burst. Many lost their jobs, and companies struggled during this time of financial adjustment. Those who followed the counsel of Elder Eyring were blessed.</p>
<p data-aid="156931721" id="p31">His promise reminded me of another experience. I met 12-year-old Charlotte Hlimi near Carcassonne, France, in 1990 while serving as a mission president. The Hlimis were a faithful family living in an apartment with eight children. They had a picture of the Savior and of the prophet on the wall. In the interview for her patriarchal blessing, I asked Charlotte if she paid an honest tithe. She responded, “Yes, President Andersen. My mother has taught me that there are temporal blessings and spiritual blessings that come from paying our tithing. My mother taught me that if we always pay our tithing, we will want for nothing. And President Andersen, we want for nothing.”</p>

<p data-aid="156931728" id="p38">In giving me permission to share her story, Charlotte, now 45 and sealed in the temple, commented: “My testimony of tithing was very real at the time, and it is even stronger now. I am deeply grateful for this commandment. As I live it I continue to be abundantly blessed.”<a class="note-ref" data-scroll-id="note25" href="/study/general-conference/2023/10/22andersen?lang=eng#note25"><sup class="marker">25</sup></a></p>
<p data-aid="156931735" id="p32">One day each of us will finish our earthly journey. Twenty-five years ago, just days before my mother-in-law, Martha Williams, died of cancer, she received a small check in the mail. She immediately asked my wife, Kathy, for her checkbook to pay her tithing. As her mother was so weakened that she could scarcely write, Kathy asked if she could write the check for her. Her mother responded, “No, Kathy. I want to do it myself.” And then she quietly added, “I want to be right before the Lord.” One of the final things Kathy did for her mother was to hand her tithing envelope to her bishop.</p>

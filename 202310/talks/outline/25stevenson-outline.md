2. **How to Invite and Recognize the Spirit:** By standing in holy places, being with holy people, bearing testimonies of holy truths, and cultivating patience to listen for the Holy Spirit, one can identify and heed the promptings of the Spirit.
3. **Words of Caution:** While inviting and recognizing the Spirit, it is important to verify our spiritual impressions align with scriptures and teachings, respect our given roles, use our judgment, and understand that answers might not always be immediate.

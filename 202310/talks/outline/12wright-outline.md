Oil in our lamps shine,
Guides us through darkest night,
Under Christ's divine light.

### Key Points

1. **Parable of the Ten Virgins:** Sister Wright references the parable of the ten virgins to emphasize the importance of spiritual preparedness. Like the wise virgins who brought oil, we too must be spiritually prepared to meet the Savior.
2. **Personal Experience with Cancer:** Using her experience after being diagnosed with cancer, she illustrated the importance of feeling at peace through spiritual preparedness. She highlighted that knowing about prayer, scriptures, repentance, the resurrection, the Plan of Salvation, eternal families and doctrine of Jesus Christ gave her the comfort that everything would be OK.
3. **Jesus Christ is our Hope:** Sister Wright emphasized that through Jesus Christ, we can sustain trial and difficulty. Everything can be OK because of Him. Our testimonies, like the evergreen Mount Carmel, are nourished daily through righteous, simple things. If we focus on Christ, our future has hope.

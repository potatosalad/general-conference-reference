Seek the Savior's light,
False idols bear no true strength,
Christ, our eternal knight.

### Key Points

1. **Hero Worship**: Bishop Waddell warns of the dangers of hero worship, noting that excessive reverence or adulation towards earthly figures - athletes, musicians, politicians - can become a stumbling block in our spiritual journey, distracting us from truly focusing on Jesus Christ. 

2. **The Real Hero:** Jesus Christ's role in defending and implementing our Father's plan, his brave submission to God's will in the Garden of Gethsemane, and his ultimate heroic act of atonement and resurrection, make him the ultimate Hero that mankind should always look up to and emulate.

3. **Choosing the Right Hero:** The speaker emphasizes that choosing Jesus Christ as our Hero has eternal implications. It is essential to put Christ first in all things, which means honoring His day, following His teachings, maintaining a temple-worthy lifestyle, and promoting peace.

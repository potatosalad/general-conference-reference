### Haiku

Temples bring us close,
Healing hearts across the sea,
In Christ, we find peace.

### Key Points

1. Elder Esplin narrates the story of a Japanese woman who, amidst the horrors of war, found strength and spiritual awakening, eventually leading her to the gospel of Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal families through temple ordinances.
2. Despite the immense challenges she faced, like the death of her husband, criticism from her community, and the geographical and linguistic barriers to attend the temple, the woman’s resolve to receive temple blessings remained unshaken.
3. The unity and love demonstrated by the Hawaiian Saints towards the Japanese Saints illustrates the healing and unifying power of temple worship and the gospel of Jesus Christ, transcending cultural and historical boundaries.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- Malachi 4:2: The scripture emphasizes the healing power of the Savior, aligning with the story of the Okinawan woman finding peace and strength in the gospel during her darkest hours.
- Doctrine & Covenants 128:18: This verse alludes to the universal spread of the knowledge of the Savior, which is highlighted in Elder Esplin's prophecy fulfilment observation, especially in "isles of the sea" like Japan.
- President Russell M. Nelson’s teachings on the heavenly power accessed through keeping covenants: This principle is vividly demonstrated in the Okinawan sister's persistence in her faith despite facing immense adversities.

### Questions to Ponder

- What can we learn from the Okinawan sister's faith, and how can we apply it in facing our own trials?
- How has temple worship helped you feel the healing power of our Savior Jesus Christ?
- How can our faith lead us to help others in the community, as the Hawaiian Saints did to the visiting Japanese Saints?
- How can we, as individuals or as a congregation, work towards eliminating historical, cultural, or racial biases to foster unity and love, exemplifying the teachings of Christ?

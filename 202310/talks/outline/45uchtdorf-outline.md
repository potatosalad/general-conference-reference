On the road back home.

### Key Points

1. **The Prodigal Son’s Journey:** Elder Uchtdorf begins with the tale of the Prodigal Son, who leaves his father's home seeking freedom away from his parents' teachings. He lives recklessly until he runs out of money amidst a famine and is left desolate and hungry, leading to his repentance and decision to return home.
   
2. **The Father's Love:** The focus shifts to the father in the parable who, upon seeing his son return, runs towards him with tears of joy. He welcomes his son with open arms, showing a testament to our Heavenly Father's unconditional love and mercy for all his children, no matter how far we've strayed.

3. **The Call for Return:** Elder Uchtdorf emphasizes that no matter how far we've strayed, the path to return home is open to us. He reassures us that even though coming back might not be easy, the moment we decide to return, Christ's power will transform our lives.

Spirit's soft whisper,
Guides us through lifeâ€™s stormy sea,
Our trusty compass.

### Key Points

2. It's vital to remember that our motives matter when we seek the companionship of the Holy Ghost. This divine gift is more readily received when our motives align with Christ's and are driven by the pure love of Christ, not selfish desires. 
3. Repentance plays a crucial role in inviting and maintaining the companionship of the Holy Ghost. When we repent, we cleanse ourselves, making ourselves more prepared to receive the influence of the Spirit.

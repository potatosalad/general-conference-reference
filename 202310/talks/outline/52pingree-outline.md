### Summary

Elder John C. Pingree Jr. emphasizes the importance of understanding, seeking, and sharing the truth, the roles of God, the Holy Ghost, and prophets in this process, and the significance of distinguishing eternal doctrine from changeable policy.

God reveals His truth,
Through His Son, Spirit divine,
Guides us in His light.

### Key Points

1. **Defining Truth**: According to the scriptures, truth is knowledge of things as they are, were, and will be. It is eternal, absolute, and can guide our actions, sanctify us, and lead us to eternal life.

2. **The Network of Revelatory Relationships**: God is the source of eternal truth, the Holy Ghost testifies of it, prophets receive and share it, and we are expected to seek, recognize and act on it. Recognizing truth from God amidst the distractive influences of the world is essential.

3. **Seeking, Recognizing, and Applying Eternal Truth**: Alder Pingree suggests asking whether something is consistently taught in the scriptures and by prophets, and whether it is confirmed by the Holy Ghost, to discern if it's truth from God. Once truth is found, it should be shared in a loving and truthful manner.

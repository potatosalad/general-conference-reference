A Father's boundless love,
In Christ we find strength to soar,
We, His beloved ones.

### Key Points

1. **We are children of God:** Understanding our divine identity as sons and daughters of God is critical to our sense of self-worth, belonging, and purpose. Embracing this truth can be transformative; knowing that we are loved unconditionally by our Heavenly Father can restore hope during challenging times.
2. **Redemptive power of Jesus Christ:** The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the ultimate expression of God's love for His children. By yoking ourselves to Him through faith and sacred covenants, we can find strength, healing, and support in navigating life's trials.
3. **Heavenly Father's Love:** Recognizing that we are loved by a perfect, glorified, loving Heavenly Father helps us to understand our priceless worth. In times of questioning and uncertainty, we are encouraged to turn to Him through prayer and seek His comfort, guidance, and understanding.

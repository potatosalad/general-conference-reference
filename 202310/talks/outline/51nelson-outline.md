### Summary

In President Russell M. Nelson's talk, "Think Celestial!", he emphasizes three key aspects: our life choices determine our eternal outcome, the importance of being spiritually minded (thinking celestial), and the significance of the Eternal family.

### Haiku

Choices carve our path,
Think celestial, shine your light,
Eternity's draft.

### Key Points

1. **The Consequence of Choices**: President Nelson emphasizes that our choices in this life will determine where and with whom we live in eternity and the type of body we will receive. Living according to Celestial laws will yield Celestial rewards.

2. **Thinking Celestial**: This means being spiritually minded and shaping our thoughts, actions, and decisions with an eternal perspective. By doing so, we align our hearts with God’s plan and experience spiritual growth.

3. **Eternal Families**: God’s eternal plan includes the sealing of families in the temple. He warns against the danger of violating such covenants, which could separate us from our families in the eternities.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

* **2 Nephi 9:39**: "to be spiritually-minded is life eternal."
* **Doctrine and Covenants 132:7,13**: "All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise... have an end when men are dead."
* **1 Timothy 4:1**: "In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils."

### Questions to Ponder

* How can we practice "thinking celestial" and being more spiritually minded day to day?
* What choices we have made so far that will impact our eternal outcome?
* How can we successfully balance our spiritual commitments and worldly responsibilities?
* How does staying close to our heavenly parents and making wise choices impact our families now and in the eternities?
* How can we show gratitude for the Atonement and Jesus Christ in our daily lives?

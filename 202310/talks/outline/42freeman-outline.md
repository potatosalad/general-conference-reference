### Summary

Sister Emily Belle Freeman encourages us to journey in committed covenant relationship with Christ, not allowing difficulties to hinder our walk on the covenant path, and outlines the blessings of maintaining a close relationship with Him.

### Haiku

On the path with Christ,
Covenants, an enduring tie,
Strength in journey's strife.

### Key Points

1. The Saviour invites us to tackle life's challenges together with Him. He wants us to rely on Him in our brokenness, just like Ilan, Sister Freeman’s Israeli guide, helped her navigate the Jesus trail on a broken ankle.
   
2. We must choose to live in committed covenant relationship with Jesus Christ. We can choose to simply be acquainted with the God of our fathers, or we can choose to bind our lives to His promises and blessings, as Jacob did.
   
3. The covenants we make are not just contractual obligations but relational ones. Just like a marriage, our covenant relationship with God requires constant emotional and spiritual investment. The Lord doesn’t intend to leave us where we are, and through His help, we can ascend and become as He is.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

* Enoch's hesitancy to respond to the Lord's call because of his limitations (Moses 6:31) reflects our own reservations in walking with the Lord in our brokenness.
* The five-finger promise given to Jacob (Genesis 28:15) represented the covenant relationship that God wants to have with us.
* President Russell M. Nelson's teaching: “The covenant path is all about our relationship with God.”

### Questions to Ponder

* How can I better walk in a covenant relationship with the Lord, especially during challenges?
* What does it mean for me to be in a committed covenant relationship with Jesus Christ?
* In what ways can I strengthen my relational aspects with God in my own covenants?
* How can I progress on the covenant path by relying on the Lord's strength?
* How can I invite others to Christ and help them strengthen their covenant relationship with Him?

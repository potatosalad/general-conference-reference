### Summary

President Oaks talks about The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' unique understanding of the post-mortal life, the importance of the choices we make in this life, and the plan for salvation provided through Christ.

### Haiku

Kingdoms three await,
Our mortal choices dictate,
God's love illuminates.

### Key Points

1. _Doctrine of Kingdoms of Glory:_ The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints teaches that all children of God will inherit one of three kingdoms of glory (the celestial, terrestrial, or telestial kingdom) depending on the choices they have made in their mortal lives.
2. _Divine Laws and Abiding in Glory:_ Each kingdom of glory has a law, and the inhabitants of a kingdom are those who can comfortably abide in the law of that kingdom. Depending on our choices in this life, we determine the kingdom where we will stay eternally.
3. _God's loving plan and Jesus Christ's Atonement:_ The ultimate aim of the Church is to prepare God’s children for exaltation in the highest level of the celestial kingdom. This can only be achieved through the Atonement of Christ, our repentance, and our faithfulness to the covenants of eternal marriage in the holy temple.

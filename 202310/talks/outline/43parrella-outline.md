### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- "Have they not read the scriptures, which say ye must take upon you the name of Christ, which is my name? For by this name shall ye be called at the last day; And whoso taketh upon him my name, and endureth to the end, the same shall be saved at the last day." - This scripture represents the core concept of bearing Christ's name as a promise made at baptism.

- President Russell M. Nelson's teaching that “Taking the Savior’s name upon us includes declaring and witnessing to others—through our actions and our words—that Jesus is the Christ.”

- Doctrine and Covenants 115:4 - Highlighting the revealed and correct name of the Church.

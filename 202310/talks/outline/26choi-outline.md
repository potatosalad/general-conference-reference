### Key Points

1. **What Is the Covenant Path?**: The covenant path is a series of agreements we make with God that brings us closer to Jesus Christ. It begins with faith, then repentance, baptism, receiving the Holy Ghost, and further covenants such as those made in the temple.

2. **Are You on the Covenant Path?**: Despite taking missteps off the covenant path at times due to various life challenges, we can always find our way back through sincere prayer and obedience to God's commands. Our obedience to God, even during difficult times, will always bring us happiness and blessings.

3. **How Can Keeping Covenants with God Make You Happy?**: By keeping our covenants with God, we yoke ourselves with Jesus Christ, allowing His strength to bolster ours and enabling us to do things we couldn't by ourselves. This divine partnership eases our burdens, leading us to a progression of happiness, and a more strengthened resilience against trials and temptations.

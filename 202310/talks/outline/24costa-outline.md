Through the trials faced,
Strength in faith lights the dark path,
In Christ, be embraced.

### Key Points

1. Draw Inspiration From Others: Elder Costa shares stories of individuals encountering extreme difficulties who, through their faith in Jesus Christ, found a source of strength to endure and overcome. They did not approach Christ because they were perfect, but because they needed His perfecting power.

2. The Principles of Consciously Practicing Faith Daily: Simple actions such as starting each day with prayer and scripture study, embracing repentance, and trying to remember Christ in every action and situation can strengthen faith and bring about change in one's life.

3. Covenants are Transformational: Keeping our covenants with God is not about a transactional relationship but, instead, it fosters transformation within us through the sanctifying power of Jesus Christ. Through our covenants, we can receive power to become better and endure trials and tribulations with courage and faith.

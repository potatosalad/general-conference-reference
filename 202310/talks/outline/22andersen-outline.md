Tithes opens heaven's gate,
Blessings forming in His grace,
Trust in Lord's timing, wait.

### Key Points

1. The divine law of tithing primarily revolves around faith rather than money. By being honest with our tithes, we demonstrate our willingness to prioritize the Lord over our personal cares and interests.
2. The tithes we offer to the Lord are used to further His work on earth, serving missionaries, building temples, supporting education, and helping those in need. 
3. Tithing brings both temporal and spiritual blessings. While some blessings are immediately clear, others are subtle and may require patience and continued faith to recognize.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- Malachi 3:11: A scripture that promises the protection of the Lord upon the offerings of his faithful followers.
- Jesus Christ's quote: "unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s." Emphasizes the clear division between our worldly and spiritual obligations.
- The Lord's directive to bring all tithes into His restored kingdom, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

### Questions to Ponder

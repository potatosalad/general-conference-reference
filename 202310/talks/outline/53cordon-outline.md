Elder Valeri V. Cordón shares insights on parenting in alignment with the gospel, focusing on creating a gospel-centered home, actively teaching children, and modeling discipleship.

### Haiku

Teach them God's pure love,
In a home learning His ways,
Parents, lead with faith.

### Key Points

1. **Climb to Higher Ground of Gospel Culture**: Elder Cordon emphasizes bringing a gospel culture into family life. This means incorporating love, expectation, and godliness into daily interactions and rejecting practices that run contrary to Church teachings. This kind of upbringing will help children return to heaven.

2. **Make Home the Center of Gospel Learning**: Home should be the primary place where children learn about the gospel. There are three key parts of this: teaching freely and without restraint, modelling discipleship through our actions, and inviting children to act in faith.

3. **Righteous, Intentional Parenting**: Parents are God’s agents and must actively instill faith and gospel principles into the lives of their children. This requires intentional effort and plans, and not just waiting for them to learn on their own.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- *John 5:19*: This verse is used to illustrate the importance of model behavior in parenting, following the example set by our Heavenly Father.
- The words of President Russell M. Nelson and President Dallin H. Oaks regarding creating a gospel culture and making the home a center of learning.
- The invitation of President Nelson for each child to take charge of his or her own testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel.

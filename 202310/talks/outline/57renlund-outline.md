Explorers seeking,
Jesus, the mark we must find;
Our truest treasure.

### Key Points

1. We can easily look beyond the mark, overlooking the Savior's role in our lives, and fail to recognize his many blessings. It is essential to keep our focus on Him and the bond He secures with us.

2. The Savior offers us numerous ways to concentrate on Him and remain disciplined in our faith. Such opportunities include repentance, partaking in sacrament meetings, maintaining the Holy Ghost's continual companionship, and making and keeping other covenants, such as those we make in the temple.

3. As temples become more geographically accessible, we must be cautious not to take them for granted or become casual about temple worship. Our commitment to attend the temple should be equally strong, regardless of its proximity.

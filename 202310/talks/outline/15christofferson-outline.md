Gathered in His name,  
Bound by sacred sealing power,  
Eternity's flame.  

### Key Points

1. **The Purpose of Gathering**: The purpose of gathering God's people is not only for their protection but primarily to confer the blessings of salvation and exaltation upon them. This is part and parcel of the covenant promises given to Abraham.
2. **The Importance of Sealing Power**: The sealing power, conferred by Elijah, validates all priesthood ordinances, enabling a covenant people to be gathered and prepared on both sides of the veil. It confers a seal of legitimacy on all ordinances, making them valid and binding beyond death. 
3. **The Role of Temples in the Sealing Power**: Temples are the places where the sealing power fully manifests, allowing the performance of vicarious ordinances. Through the sealing power, individual salvation and family exaltation becomes universally available for all children of God, regardless of where or when they have lived. 

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- **Isaiah's Prophecy**: The prophecy about the gathering of Israel is referenced from Isaiah.
- **Doctrine and Covenants**: Multiple scriptures such as Doctrine and Covenants 128:8 are referenced to illustrate the importance of the Seal and the validity it gives to ordinances.
- **Moroni's Teaching**: Moroni's teaching to Joseph Smith of Elijah's role in revealing priesthood authority is quoted, affirming the validity of ordinances in both time and eternity.

### Questions to Ponder

- What is the significance of the sealing power in the Plan of Salvation?
- How can we make preparation to receive all the blessings of the sealing power in the temples?
- In what ways does being sealed in the temple impact our individual and family exaltation?
- How does the sealing power manifest divine justice, mercy, and love?
- How can we help to strengthen the chain of generations in our own families, especially if there have been broken links in the past?

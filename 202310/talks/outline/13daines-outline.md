### Haiku

Seeking Jesus' face,
In covenants, grace, and love,
His mercy we trace.

### Key Points

1. **Face-Blindness and Understanding Jesus**: Using the analogy of 'face blindness', Elder Daines encourages those who see God more as a giver of rules than a loving Father to strive to know Jesus Christ better, to recognize Him and His love amidst the rules.
2. **Reading The Gospels - Jesus and His Love**: Elder Daines underscores the importance of studying the four Gospels not merely for the extraction of rules but to recognize the love and mercy of Jesus, as well as His willingness to touch, heal, and feed the downtrodden and marginalized of society. 
3. **Covenants as the Cure for Spiritual Face-Blindness**: Elder Daines emphasises the relationship-based nature of covenants, viewing them as the path to comprehending God's love and mercy. He advocates seeing our covenants as the shape of God’s embrace, as windows to his mercy.

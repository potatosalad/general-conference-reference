### Summary

Elder Giraud-Carrier teaches that we should see each other as children of God, beyond any mortal labels or distinctions, and treat each other accordingly.

### Haiku

Beyond mortal guise,
See His children, understand,
With love in our eyes.

### Key Points

1. Elder Giraud-Carrier points out that we often pass judgment or conclusions based on appearance, hearsay, or labels. This is not how the Lord views us - He sees the heart and the potential within each of His children.

2. We are first and foremost children of God, regardless of our cultural background, nationality, social standing, or any other label. Our divine origin and limitless potential are promised through the grace of Jesus Christ.

3. Our attitudes and actions towards others should reflect our understanding of our heavenly parentage. We should strive to see and treat others as the Lord does, with love and acceptance, regardless of their circumstances or differences.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- 1 Samuel 16:7: A scripture referred to where God rectifies Samuel's perception of potential kings, emphasizing that man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. 
- Acts 9:15: The Lord calls Saul an unexpected chosen vessel, thereby teaching Ananias not to judge by reputation or hearsay.
- 2 Nephi 26:33: This scripture states that all are alike unto God, an important principle reiterated throughout the talk.
- Romans 8:16: Cited in the talk as evidence of our divine heritage as children of God.

### Questions to Ponder

- How can we move past our judgments based on appearance or hearsay and see the hearts of those around us?
- How does understanding our divine heritage influence how we view and treat others?
- How can we strive to see and minister to others as the Lord does, regardless of their circumstances or differences?
- How does the principle of 'covenant belonging' impact our interactions and relationships within the church community?
- As children of Heavenly Father, how should we re-evaluate the labels we attach to individuals?

2. **Gospel Language of Service and Sacrifice:** This principle emphasizes the importance of selfless service and sacrifice in expressing our love and devotion to the Lord, and in fulfilling our covenant commitments to Him and to each other.

3. **Gospel Language of Covenant Belonging:** Elder Gong highlighted the importance of understanding and acknowledging our covenant relationships with the Lord and with each other to express love and strengthen our bonds of unity and belonging in the gospel.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- "Perfect love casteth out fear” (1 John 4:18)
- "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Matthew 16:25-26)

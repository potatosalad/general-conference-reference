In the path of duty,
Faithful steps unnoticed weave,
Service quietly achieved.

### Key Points

1. **They of the Last Wagon:** Elder Bednar recounts President J. Reuben Clark's tribute to pioneers who followed the wagon trains, enduring hardship and choking on the dust of those in front of them. These unsung heroes are compared to those in the church today who continue faithful and relentless in their duties without seeking fame or glory.
2. **No Less Serviceable:** Drawing from President Howard W. Hunter's teachings, Elder Bednar discusses the significance of quiet service and the value of those who are “no less serviceable”, playing a crucial but less noticeable role within the church. These individuals, though not conspicuous, are described as being as helpful or useful as more prominent figures.
3. **In the Path of Their Duty:** Elder Bednar expresses gratitude for the millions of members around the world who walk the covenant path, offering examples of individuals fulfilling their duties in various ways. These individuals’ serviceable acts include comforting others, supporting church leadership, repenting, abiding by their covenants, translating gospel truths, honoring parenthood, teaching children, caring for loved ones and more. These actions, though humble, contribute to salvation for many and demonstrate unwavering dedication to the gospel.

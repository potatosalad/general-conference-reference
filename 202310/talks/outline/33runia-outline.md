### Key Points

1. **The Overview Lens:** Sister Runia introduces the idea of the "overview lens" which involves viewing ourselves and our families from an eternal perspective. This lens allows for optimism, patience, and a long-term view on our journeys.

2. **The Role of Love, Empathy, and Encouragement:** Sister Runia emphasizes the importance of love, empathy, and encouragement in our familial relationships. She shares personal experiences about her father's hopeful approach and how it helped her. She also emphasizes expressing messages of hope and love to loved ones instead of criticism and judgment.

3. **Patience and Hope in Rough Times:** Worry and panic, Sister Runia argues, are not productive emotions. God views us with patience and infinite love, hoping we'll display similar attributes with our loved ones. Urging patience instead of speed, she reminds us that everyone is on their journey, and progress is more important than pace. 

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- Moroni's description of those who see with "an eye of faith" emphasizes the value of faith in our understanding and experience of hope and joy (Ether 12:19).

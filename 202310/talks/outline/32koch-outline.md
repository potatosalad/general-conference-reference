### Haiku

A humble heart's call,  
Submission to God's great will,  
Grace through covenants realized.

### Key Points

1. Humility should not be confused with being poor or lacking self-esteem. Humility is a willingness to submit to the will of the Lord and being teachable.
2. Humility includes following the counsel of our prophets in all aspects of our lives, valuing their guidance over our own opinions or the philosophies of men.
3. Humility accepts that we cannot overcome our challenges or achieve our full potential without Heavenly Father's benevolence and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It implies recognizing our dependence on God and making and keeping His covenants.

### Summary

Elder David A. Bednar discusses the importance of diligence and dedication within the duties of the gospel, acknowledging the often unseen and unrecognized efforts of the faithful who serve quietly and without seeking acknowledgment or praise.

### Haiku

In the path of duty,
Faithful steps unnoticed weave,
Service quietly achieved.

### Key Points

1. **They of the Last Wagon:** Elder Bednar recounts President J. Reuben Clark's tribute to pioneers who followed the wagon trains, enduring hardship and choking on the dust of those in front of them. These unsung heroes are compared to those in the church today who continue faithful and relentless in their duties without seeking fame or glory.
2. **No Less Serviceable:** Drawing from President Howard W. Hunter's teachings, Elder Bednar discusses the significance of quiet service and the value of those who are “no less serviceable”, playing a crucial but less noticeable role within the church. These individuals, though not conspicuous, are described as being as helpful or useful as more prominent figures.
3. **In the Path of Their Duty:** Elder Bednar expresses gratitude for the millions of members around the world who walk the covenant path, offering examples of individuals fulfilling their duties in various ways. These individuals’ serviceable acts include comforting others, supporting church leadership, repenting, abiding by their covenants, translating gospel truths, honoring parenthood, teaching children, caring for loved ones and more. These actions, though humble, contribute to salvation for many and demonstrate unwavering dedication to the gospel.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

* **Doctrine and Covenants 138:15**: The scripture promises blessings to all who have endured valiantly for the gospel of Jesus Christ, providing assurance to those diligently working in the path of their duty.

### Questions to Ponder

* How can you be "no less serviceable" in your roles in the Church, family, and community?
* What does the phrase "in the path of their duty" mean to you, and how does it apply to your life and commitment to gospel principles?
* How can you better acknowledge and appreciate the unseen and often unrecognized efforts of others around you in their service to the Lord?
* How does understanding the concept of quiet, diligent service influence your approach to your calling or other responsibilities within the Church?

## 21. Walking in Covenant Relationship with Christ - President Emily Belle Freeman

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/42freeman?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/42freeman?lang=eng)

### Summary

Sister Emily Belle Freeman encourages us to journey in committed covenant relationship with Christ, not allowing difficulties to hinder our walk on the covenant path, and outlines the blessings of maintaining a close relationship with Him.

### Haiku

On the path with Christ,
Covenants, an enduring tie,
Strength in journey's strife.

### Key Points

1. The Saviour invites us to tackle life's challenges together with Him. He wants us to rely on Him in our brokenness, just like Ilan, Sister Freeman’s Israeli guide, helped her navigate the Jesus trail on a broken ankle.
   
2. We must choose to live in committed covenant relationship with Jesus Christ. We can choose to simply be acquainted with the God of our fathers, or we can choose to bind our lives to His promises and blessings, as Jacob did.
   
3. The covenants we make are not just contractual obligations but relational ones. Just like a marriage, our covenant relationship with God requires constant emotional and spiritual investment. The Lord doesn’t intend to leave us where we are, and through His help, we can ascend and become as He is.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

* Enoch's hesitancy to respond to the Lord's call because of his limitations (Moses 6:31) reflects our own reservations in walking with the Lord in our brokenness.
* The five-finger promise given to Jacob (Genesis 28:15) represented the covenant relationship that God wants to have with us.

* What does it mean for me to be in a committed covenant relationship with Jesus Christ?
* In what ways can I strengthen my relational aspects with God in my own covenants?
* How can I progress on the covenant path by relying on the Lord's strength?
* How can I invite others to Christ and help them strengthen their covenant relationship with Him?

2. The Savior offers us numerous ways to concentrate on Him and remain disciplined in our faith. Such opportunities include repentance, partaking in sacrament meetings, maintaining the Holy Ghost's continual companionship, and making and keeping other covenants, such as those we make in the temple.

### Haiku

God reveals His truth,
Through His Son, Spirit divine,

2. **The Network of Revelatory Relationships**: God is the source of eternal truth, the Holy Ghost testifies of it, prophets receive and share it, and we are expected to seek, recognize and act on it. Recognizing truth from God amidst the distractive influences of the world is essential.

3. **Seeking, Recognizing, and Applying Eternal Truth**: Alder Pingree suggests asking whether something is consistently taught in the scriptures and by prophets, and whether it is confirmed by the Holy Ghost, to discern if it's truth from God.

- What should our response be when we are seeking truth that has not yet been revealed to us?

Elder Valeri V. Cordón shares insights on parenting in alignment with the gospel, focusing on creating a gospel-centered home, actively teaching children, and modeling discipleship.

### Haiku

Teach them God's pure love,
In a home learning His ways,
Parents, lead with faith.

### Key Points

1. **Climb to Higher Ground of Gospel Culture**: Elder Cordon emphasizes bringing a gospel culture into family life. This means incorporating love, expectation, and godliness into daily interactions and rejecting practices that run contrary to Church teachings. This kind of upbringing will help children return to heaven.

2. **Make Home the Center of Gospel Learning**: Home should be the primary place where children learn about the gospel. There are three key parts of this: teaching freely and without restraint, modelling discipleship through our actions, and inviting children to act in faith.

3. **Righteous, Intentional Parenting**: Parents are God’s agents and must actively instill faith and gospel principles into the lives of their children. This requires intentional effort and plans, and not just waiting for them to learn on their own.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- *John 5:19*: This verse is used to illustrate the importance of model behavior in parenting, following the example set by our Heavenly Father.
- The words of President Russell M. Nelson and President Dallin H. Oaks regarding creating a gospel culture and making the home a center of learning.
- The invitation of President Nelson for each child to take charge of his or her own testimony of Jesus Christ and His gospel.

### Questions to Ponder

- How can we incorporate a gospel culture into our family life more effectively?
- In what ways can our homes become more centered on gospel learning? How can we teach our children freely and without restraint in today's world?
- What actions can we take to show our discipleship to our children?
- How can we be more active and intentional in the spiritual upbringing of our children?
- What obstacles or challenges do we face in trying to create a gospel-centered home, and how can we overcome them?

## 30. The Savior’s Healing Power upon the Isles of the Sea - Elder J. Kimo Esplin

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/55esplin?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/55esplin?lang=eng)

### Summary

Elder J. Kimo Esplin discusses the power of temple blessings and its capacity to heal and unite individuals, families, and nations, using the example of a courageous Japanese woman who faced adversities and found strength in the gospel of Jesus Christ.

### Haiku

Temples bring us close,
Healing hearts across the sea,
In Christ, we find peace.

### Key Points

1. Elder Esplin narrates the story of a Japanese woman who, amidst the horrors of war, found strength and spiritual awakening, eventually leading her to the gospel of Jesus Christ and the promise of eternal families through temple ordinances.
2. Despite the immense challenges she faced, like the death of her husband, criticism from her community, and the geographical and linguistic barriers to attend the temple, the woman’s resolve to receive temple blessings remained unshaken.
3. The unity and love demonstrated by the Hawaiian Saints towards the Japanese Saints illustrates the healing and unifying power of temple worship and the gospel of Jesus Christ, transcending cultural and historical boundaries.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- Malachi 4:2: The scripture emphasizes the healing power of the Savior, aligning with the story of the Okinawan woman finding peace and strength in the gospel during her darkest hours.
- Doctrine & Covenants 128:18: This verse alludes to the universal spread of the knowledge of the Savior, which is highlighted in Elder Esplin's prophecy fulfilment observation, especially in "isles of the sea" like Japan.
- President Russell M. Nelson’s teachings on the heavenly power accessed through keeping covenants: This principle is vividly demonstrated in the Okinawan sister's persistence in her faith despite facing immense adversities.

### Questions to Ponder

- What can we learn from the Okinawan sister's faith, and how can we apply it in facing our own trials?
- How has temple worship helped you feel the healing power of our Savior Jesus Christ?
- How can our faith lead us to help others in the community, as the Hawaiian Saints did to the visiting Japanese Saints?
- How can we, as individuals or as a congregation, work towards eliminating historical, cultural, or racial biases to foster unity and love, exemplifying the teachings of Christ?

## 31. Love Is Spoken Here - Elder Gerrit W. Gong

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/54gong?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/54gong?lang=eng)

### Summary

Elder Gerrit W. Gong speaks about the different languages of gospel love—warmth and reverence, service and sacrifice, and covenant belonging—and encourages members of the Church to learn to both speak and hear these languages.

### Haiku

Love spoken, Love heard,  
In service, sacrifice, warmth,  
Covenant conferred.

### Key Points

1. **Gospel Language of Warmth and Reverence:** This language involves expressing love and reverence in our relationship with the Lord, our families, and others, including the use of warm and relevant language in our prayers and interactions with each other.

2. **Gospel Language of Service and Sacrifice:** This principle emphasizes the importance of selfless service and sacrifice in expressing our love and devotion to the Lord, and in fulfilling our covenant commitments to Him and to each other.

3. **Gospel Language of Covenant Belonging:** Elder Gong highlighted the importance of understanding and acknowledging our covenant relationships with the Lord and with each other to express love and strengthen our bonds of unity and belonging in the gospel.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- "Perfect love casteth out fear” (1 John 4:18)
- "For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?" (Matthew 16:25-26)
- Talks by President J. Reuben Clark on the principle of loving service and Elder David B. Haight on maintaining a calling in the Church

### Questions to Ponder

- How can we learn to better express our love using the three languages Elder Gong has highlighted?
- In what ways can we demonstrate the language of service and sacrifice in our lives?
- How does our covenant belonging with God and others affect our relationships and our expression of love in the gospel?
- How can we improve our communication and understanding of these three gospel languages of love?


## 32. We Are His Children - Elder Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/56giraud-carrier?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/56giraud-carrier?lang=eng)

### Summary

Elder Giraud-Carrier teaches that we should see each other as children of God, beyond any mortal labels or distinctions, and treat each other accordingly.

### Haiku

Beyond mortal guise,
See His children, understand,
With love in our eyes.

### Key Points

1. Elder Giraud-Carrier points out that we often pass judgment or conclusions based on appearance, hearsay, or labels. This is not how the Lord views us - He sees the heart and the potential within each of His children.

2. We are first and foremost children of God, regardless of our cultural background, nationality, social standing, or any other label. Our divine origin and limitless potential are promised through the grace of Jesus Christ.

3. Our attitudes and actions towards others should reflect our understanding of our heavenly parentage. We should strive to see and treat others as the Lord does, with love and acceptance, regardless of their circumstances or differences.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

- 1 Samuel 16:7: A scripture referred to where God rectifies Samuel's perception of potential kings, emphasizing that man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. 
- Acts 9:15: The Lord calls Saul an unexpected chosen vessel, thereby teaching Ananias not to judge by reputation or hearsay.
- 2 Nephi 26:33: This scripture states that all are alike unto God, an important principle reiterated throughout the talk.
- Romans 8:16: Cited in the talk as evidence of our divine heritage as children of God.

### Questions to Ponder

- How can we move past our judgments based on appearance or hearsay and see the hearts of those around us?
- How does understanding our divine heritage influence how we view and treat others?
- How can we strive to see and minister to others as the Lord does, regardless of their circumstances or differences?
- How does the principle of 'covenant belonging' impact our interactions and relationships within the church community?
- As children of Heavenly Father, how should we re-evaluate the labels we attach to individuals?

## 33. Think Celestial! - President Russell M. Nelson

[https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/51nelson?lang=eng](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org//study/general-conference/2023/10/51nelson?lang=eng)

### Summary

In President Russell M. Nelson's talk, "Think Celestial!", he emphasizes three key aspects: our life choices determine our eternal outcome, the importance of being spiritually minded (thinking celestial), and the significance of the Eternal family.

### Haiku

Choices carve our path,
Think celestial, shine your light,
Eternity's draft.

### Key Points

1. **The Consequence of Choices**: President Nelson emphasizes that our choices in this life will determine where and with whom we live in eternity and the type of body we will receive. Living according to Celestial laws will yield Celestial rewards.

2. **Thinking Celestial**: This means being spiritually minded and shaping our thoughts, actions, and decisions with an eternal perspective. By doing so, we align our hearts with God’s plan and experience spiritual growth.

3. **Eternal Families**: God’s eternal plan includes the sealing of families in the temple. He warns against the danger of violating such covenants, which could separate us from our families in the eternities.

### Scriptures and Gospel Principles

* **2 Nephi 9:39**: "to be spiritually-minded is life eternal."
* **Doctrine and Covenants 132:7,13**: "All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise... have an end when men are dead."
* **1 Timothy 4:1**: "In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils."

### Questions to Ponder

* How can we practice "thinking celestial" and being more spiritually minded day to day?
* What choices we have made so far that will impact our eternal outcome?
* How can we successfully balance our spiritual commitments and worldly responsibilities?
* How does staying close to our heavenly parents and making wise choices impact our families now and in the eternities?
* How can we show gratitude for the Atonement and Jesus Christ in our daily lives?
